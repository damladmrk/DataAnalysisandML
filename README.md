# DataAnalysisandML

This repository is a personal machine learning and data analysis workspace.  
It contains reusable tools, core learning algorithms, and dataset-driven experiments developed while studying and practicing machine learning.

The goal of this repository is not to provide a single finished product, but to document and explore how data, models, and algorithms behave in practice.

It focuses on:
- Understanding learning algorithms at a deeper level  
- Writing reusable and adaptable analysis tools  
- Applying models to real datasets  
- Connecting theory with hands-on experimentation

## MLFunctions.py

A collection of custom-built helper functions created to simplify and standardize data analysis and machine learning workflows.

Instead of rewriting preprocessing, evaluation, and visualization code for every project, this file acts as a flexible toolkit that can be reused across different datasets.

It focuses on:
- Adaptive data handling  
- Reusable plotting and evaluation utilities  
- Rapid experimentation  

---

## core_learning_algorithms.py

This file contains implementations of core machine learning algorithms.

It includes:
- Linear regression  
- Learning rules and optimization logic  
- TensorFlow-based model construction  

The purpose of this file is to understand how learning happens mathematically and computationally:
- How models update  
- How errors propagate  
- How parameters converge

## Dataset-Based Projects

These files apply machine learning and data analysis techniques to specific datasets.

### fake_news_prediction.py
A supervised learning project for detecting fake news using text-based and feature-driven classification methods.

### house_price_prediction.py
A regression project for predicting house prices from structured housing data.

### loan_status_prediction.py
A classification project for predicting whether a loan will be approved based on financial and personal attributes.

### turkey_car_market_analysis.py
An exploratory and predictive analysis of the Turkish car market, focusing on pricing trends and feature relationships.

---

## Deep Learning Experiments

### tensorflow_project.py
A project exploring neural network models built using TensorFlow.

### tensorflow&pytorch.py
A comparison and experimentation file working with both TensorFlow and PyTorch to understand differences in model definition, training, and evaluation.

---

## mit_lectures.py

A collection of notes, implementations, and experiments based on MIT course materials:
- 6.006  
- 6.034  
- 6.036  

These files contain algorithmic and machine learning concepts translated into runnable Python code and structured notes.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning lab for:
- Machine learning fundamentals  
- Algorithmic thinking  
- Data-driven modeling  
- Practical experimentation  

It reflects an ongoing process of understanding how intelligent systems learn, adapt, and make decisions from data.
